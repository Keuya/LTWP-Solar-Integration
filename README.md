# LTWP Solar Integration Project 

##  Overview
This project optimizes **solar PV integration** for **Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP)** using **PVsyst simulations**. The goal is to enhance renewable energy generation by integrating a solar PV system into the existing wind power plant, ensuring **grid stability, feasibility, and bankability**.

## Key Findings
✔ **Solar Capacity:** 77.50 MWp | 74.62 MWac  
✔ **Performance Ratio (PR):** 86.16%  
✔ **Annual Energy Injected to Grid:** 199.34 GWh  
✔ **LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity):** €0.0194/kWh  
✔ **Payback Period:** 4.1 years
